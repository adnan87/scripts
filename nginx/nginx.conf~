# Nginx Production Server configuration V 0.1
# Nginx main block configuration file.
# The most important directives here are ssl_protocols and ssl_ciphers
# Keep nginx configuration in repo, then just include it in /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
# And DDoS prevent attack with directive limit_req_zone (limit 10 request/sec from 1 IP address)
# then it enables in the server block by "limit_req zone=one".

#########################################################################################################
# Explaination of attributes which will help us to  configure nginx for better results.
#
#  @ user - helps us to specify the by which user the worker process will be spawned.
#  @ worker_processes - helps us to specify how many worker process will be spawned at a time from nginx
#    Run command the below commands & get the number of CPU processor / cores 
#        $grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l
#  @ worker_priority - negative number means higher priority. Range normally varies from -20 to 20
#  @ timer_resolution - Reduces timer resolution in worker processes reducing the number system calls 
#    for gettimeofday() function this is made after specific interval specified in value.
#  @ error_log - configure error log path & log level 
#     log levels[ debug | info | notice | warn | error | crit | alert | emerg]
#  @ access_log - suggested to keep off as it hit IO operations a lot.
#  @ events / use - epoll is effective method used on Linux 2.6+.ref http://wiki.nginx.org/Optimizations
#  @ events / worker_connections - "Max clients" is also limited by the number of socket connections 
#    available on the system (~64k).
#  @ client_max_body_size - size of file uploaded from application
#  @ client_body_buffer_size - If the request body size is more than the buffer size, then the entire 
#    (or partial) request body is written into a temporary file.
#  @ client_body_temp_path - path where the uploaded file will be buffered.
#  @ sendfile - set it to on as Sendfile copies data between one FD and other from within the kernel. 
#    More efficient than r+ w+, since the requires transferring data to and from the user space.
#  @ tcp_nopush - use with send file to reduce socket connections
#  @ tcp_nodelay - use with send file to reduce socket connections
#  @ keepalive_timeout - server will close connection after this time this will avoid large queues.
#  @ open_file_cache - tell nginx max files to be cached & maintain it for how many seconds
#  @ open_file_cache_valid - cache validity
#  @ open_file_cache_errors - Enables or disables caching of file lookup errors by open_file_cache
#  @ gzip_* - all attribute realted to enable gzip on nginx http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpGzipModule
